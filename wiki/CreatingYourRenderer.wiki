#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

= Introduction =

The purpose of this page is to go over what you need to do to create a basic application using gwtsilimietimeline.  What we are basically going to do is to take a skeleton of the Stonehenge renderer and build our own.   This is not meant to be a detailed, feature rich explanation.

= Details =

0. This tutorial was written with the following facts in mind:  

Tools: GWT 1.5, Eclipse 3.3 Winter Europa.
You have Stonehenge up and running

1. We are going to create this class and then implement this interface for ITimeLineRenderer.

import com.netthreads.gwt.simile.timeline.client.ITimeLineRender;
import com.netthreads.gwt.simile.timeline.client.TimeLineWidget;

public class TimelineRendererTutorial implements ITimeLineRender {

	public void render(TimeLineWidget widget) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
	}

}

2.  You may want resize your application:  You will drive yourself crazy if you try to 
change the size of the TimelineRendererTutorial object.  Instead, you must change the size of the widget inside the TimelineRendererTutorial class.  For our case, we are going to se t this size to:  widget.setPixelSize(200,200);
